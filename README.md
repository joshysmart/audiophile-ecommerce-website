## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
  - Shipping always adds a random price to the order
  - VAT is calculated as 7.5% of the product total, excluding shipping
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- **Bonus**: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Remix](https://remix.run/) - React framework
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - Server side library
- [MongoDB.](https://www.mongodb.com/) - NoSQL database

### What I learned

I learnt alot working on this app considering its my first fullstack web application.

The backend was a bit challenging and i received great responses to my question on the remix discord server

### Continued development

I intend to focus on improving my web development skills as a fullstack web developer. I am open to learning more modern framwork that enables the simplicity of creating flexible modern pages.

I also intend on making improvements on the site as my learning progresses.

I would be focusing on gaining more understanding of

- Prisma
- MongoDB
- Remix (more-indepth)
- Nodejs
- Typescript

### Useful resources

- [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema) - This helped me in creating the schema for MongoDB and making CRUD requests.
- [Remix documentation](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1) - This helped me in getting started with remix. They have an awesome tutorial for coding along
